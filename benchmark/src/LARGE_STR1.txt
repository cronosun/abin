Currently, the oldest version of Rust believed to work is 1.36. Future versions of Criterion.rs may break support for such old versions, and this will not be considered a breaking change. If you require Criterion.rs to work on old versions of Rust, you will need to stick to a specific patch version of Criterion.rs. The primary goal of Criterion.rs is to provide a powerful and statistically rigorous tool for measuring the performance of code, preventing performance regressions and accurately measuring optimizations. Additionally, it should be as programmer-friendly as possible and make it easy to create reliable, useful benchmarks, even for programmers without an advanced background in statistics. In order to generate plots, you must have gnuplot installed. See the gnuplot website for installation instructions. See Compatibility Policy for details on the minimum supported Rust version. Criterion.rs helps you write fast code by detecting and measuring performance improvements or regressions, even small ones, quickly and accurately. You can optimize with confidence, knowing how each change affects the performance of your code. Criterion.rs supports the last three stable minor releases of Rust. At time of writing, this means Rust 1.40 or later. Older versions may work, but are not tested or guaranteed.
